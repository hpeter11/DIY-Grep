Task 2-B

Problem 1:
public List<Video> getSearchResults(Hashtable<String,
List<Video>> videoTable, String category) {

return v;
OR:

String link = null;
LinkedList<Video> v = videoTable.get(category);
    for (Video i : v) {
    return link + i;
    }
return (some combination of links to videos and their thumbnails);

}

Problem 2:
public List<Video> getRelatedVideoRecommendations(Hashtable
<String,List<Video>> videoTable, String category) {

String link = null;
LinkedList<Video> v = videoTable.get(category);

    for (Video i : v) {
    if (i != this video)
    link + i;
    }

return link (some combination of links to videos and their thumbnails except
for the video that was just watched)

}

Task 2-C:
Assuming I understood the task correctly, it seems as though we would be asked
to either return a list of the most recommended videos in a category or to
output the most recommended videos with the ones you've watched already
filtered out. In both cases, you should use the category as a key to access
a list of recommended videos. In the second case, however, it was important
that the list was filtered to keep providing new options.

Task 2-E
Dear Bossperson,

So far, I have learned that it is important to keep a list of videos that
correspond to certain categories. It is also important to keep this list
ordered by most popular to please customers. I have also learned that we will
need to filter this list for every user in order to avoid recommending them
the same videos. However, I have also discovered that this increases the risk
of filter bubbles. This could keep YooToob's visitors insulated from new
content from other genres or different perspectives. This bubble could be
damaging and toxic to our website and its users. Therefore, we should work to
recommend a unique variety of content from all sorts of creators, genres, and
viewpoints to diversify our options and platform.
